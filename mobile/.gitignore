# Note: If you are NOT using specific native code (Prebuild), you might want to ignore android/ and ios/ folders if they are generated. 
# If you ARE using continuous native generation (CNG), ignored is correct. 
# If you have ejected or have custom native code, you should NOT ignore them (but ignore build folders inside them).
# Assuming standard managed/CNG workflow since no android/ios folders were visible in previous ls (only 10 children, likely source files).
